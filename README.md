Project Description 

Our project is called MoneyMate. MoneyMate allows users to store their expense information onto a database that they create on their computer. 
The main goal of MoneyMate is to give its users the ability to track their spending habits, so they can have a better handle on their finances. 
Some additional features MoneyMate provides include user registration, login, adding expenses, viewing expenses, deleting expenses, and generating expense reports. 
These features help MoneyMate meet its goal by giving users a chance to categorize and monitor how their money is spent, 
ensuring a smooth user experience with an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
